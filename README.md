### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Live Data Collection**  
   - Scrapes or fetches data from a **Sports API**.  
   - Collects match stats like possession, shots, goals, etc.

2. **Data Processing & Analytics**  
   - Cleans and structures the data.  
   - Performs real-time analysis of key metrics and patterns.

3. **AI-Based Prediction**  
   - Uses **OpenAI's GPT** to interpret data contextually.  
   - Predicts likely match outcomes (win/loss/draw, scores, etc.)
